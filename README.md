### What?
DoomCaster is a project that renders a pseudo-3D map using a raycasting algorithm. It has the following features:
- Map editor.
- Top-down raycast algorithm visualizer.
- 3D map, which can be explored with the WASD keys.

### Why?
I wanted to practice, and strengthen my C/C++ programming skills to become a more competitive programmer in the Game Development industry, as well as learn more about 3D graphics, 3D mathematics, and rendering algorithms as much as possible.

Doom is one of the most disruptive videogames ever created, as it set a new standard for the games industry, and was the stepping stone in the transition to 3D graphics in games. It began development in 1992, and was released in 1993 by John Carmack, John Romero, Adrian Carmack, Kevin Cloud, and Tom Hall selling more than one million copies!

I have nothing but respect for the developers of id software, since they are some of the game changers that moved the industry forward and a huge inspiration to me. It blows me away what they were able to achieve with the limited technologies they had during their time, so I wanted to learn how they did it firsthand!
